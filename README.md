# A guide to using hemispherical photos for estimation of forest/woodland canopy traits.

This repository collects together a number of pieces of writing, R code and ImageJ macros, that I have produced while learning about hemispherical photography methods for estimating tree canopy traits.


* `img/` contains various images used in the guide
* `macros/` contains a number of ImageJ macro scripts and a copy of the ImageJ catalogue of built-in macro functions.
* `phone_camera_compare/` contains data and scripts for an analysis of the ability of two clip on phone lenses to replicate the gap fraction estimates taken by a Nikon D750 DSLR with a sigma 8mm fisheye lens.
* `hemiphot/` contains code and resources for using Hans ter Steege's port of WinPhot to the R language.

* `hemi_guide.md` is a purely subjective guide on how I think hemispherical photographs should be captured and analysed.
* `infinity_focus.md` provides a collection of references from the peer-reviewed literature supporting setting the camera focus to infinity when taking canopy photos.

* `fov_func.R` provides two functions used for cropping full-frame hemispherical photographs to different angles of view. To be used in conjunction with ImageJ macros to crop the images and analyse the gap fraction within the crop.
