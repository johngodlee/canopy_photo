# A guide to using hemispherical photos for estimation of forest/woodland canopy traits.

This repository contains a guide on hemispherical photography (`hemiphoto_guide.pdf`), with associated R code and ImageJ macros that I have produced while learning about hemispherical photography methods for estimating tree canopy traits.

* `img/` contains various images used in the guide
* `src/` contains a number of ImageJ macro scripts R code, the Hemiphot codebase, and schematic diagrams used as supplementary materials in the guide.
